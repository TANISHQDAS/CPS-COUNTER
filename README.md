Hello friend,

In this project, I developed a Clicks Per Second (CPS) counter. The program measures how fast you can click by calculating your clicks per second (CPS) during a set time interval(here it is 10 sec). It also includes a countdown timer and the ability to retry, making it fun and easy to challenge yourself or others. I hope you find it engaging and enjoy using it!
